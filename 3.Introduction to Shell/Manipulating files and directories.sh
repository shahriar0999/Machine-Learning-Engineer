# grep can search for patterns as well; we will explore those in the next course. What's more important right now is some of grep's more common flags:

# -c: print a count of matching lines rather than the lines themselves
# -h: do not print the names of files when searching multiple files
# -i: ignore case (e.g., treat "Regression" and "regression" as matches)
# -l: print the names of files that contain matches, not the matches
# -n: print line numbers for matching lines
# -v: invert the match, i.e., only show lines that don't match
